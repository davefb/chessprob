<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>    This Python module does not know how to <em>play</em> chess, but does
    understand the rules enough that it can watch moves and verify
    that they are correct.</p>
<h3>Getting the software</h3>
<p>    The software is available in a tarball here:
    <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/chess/chess-latest.tar.gz">http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/chess/chess-latest.tar.gz</a>.</p>
<p>    The official URL for this Web site is
    <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/chess/">http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/chess/</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>    This module has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>high abstraction</p></li>
<li><p>understands various notations, including algebraic, long
      algebraic, and standard algebraic notation (as in PGN); does
      disambiguation</p></li>
<li><p>supports saving and loading of the state of a game</p></li>
<li><p>not a trivial move processor; understands the intracies of the
      game</p></li>

</ul>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>    The following standard abbreviations are used:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>K = king</p></li>
<li><p>Q = queen</p></li>
<li><p>B = bishop</p></li>
<li><p>N = knight (note: not Kn)</p></li>
<li><p>R = rook</p></li>
<li><p>P = pawn</p></li>

</ul>
<p>    Uppercase letters are used to represent white pieces, lowercase
    black.  Squares on the chessboard are identified with the standard
    algebraic notation of a (lowercase) letter a-h followed by a
    number 1-8, which represent file (column) and rank (row)
    respectively, with 1 being the white home rank and 8 being black.
    The default state of the chessboard is:
<pre>
        . . a b c d e f g h . .
        . +-----------------+ .
        8 | r n b q k b n r | 8
        7 | p p p p p p p p | 7
        6 | . . . . . . . . | 6
        5 | . . . . . . . . | 5
        4 | . . . . . . . . | 4
        3 | . . . . . . . . | 3
        2 | P P P P P P P P | 2
        1 | R N B Q K B N R | 1
        . +-----------------+ .
        . . a b c d e f g h . .
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>    The chest.py test program demonstrates the general way the module
    is intended to be used.  The constants <code>WHITE</code> and <code>BLACK</code> are
    used to indicate colors.  Create a <code>Game</code> instance, call its
    <code>move</code> method with names, which returns instances of a <code>Move</code>
    class to indicate the state of the resulting move, and raises
    errors on encountering problems.  The <code>ok</code> method indicates
    whether or not the game is over.</p>
<h3>Notation</h3>
<p>    The move disambiguator is somewhat sophisticated and understands a
    variety of notation types:</p>
<dl>
<dt>    <strong>algebraic notation (AN)</strong></dt>
<dd>The most widely used of simple
    chess notations, simply consisting of two algebraic locations
    indicating a starting square and an ending square; e.g., d2d4,
    g1f3, d5e6.</dd>
<dt>    <strong>long algebraic notation (LAN)</strong></dt>
<dd>Extended algebraic, including
    an intervening <em>-</em> for moves and <em>x</em> for piece captures, as well
    as a preceding (uppercase, regardless of color) piece type; e.g.,
    Pd2-d4, Ng1-f3, Pd5xe6.</dd>
<dt>    <strong>standard algebraic notation (SAN)</strong></dt>
<dd>As described by the
    Portable Game Notation (PGN).  <a href="http://www.very-best.de/pgn-spec.htm">A full specification is
    available</a>, but the key
    features are as follows:
<ul>
<li><p>Non-capturing moves generally involve only the piece type
          and the destination square, where pawns are generally not
          listed; e.g., d4, Nf3, Qd6. When disambiguation of moves is
          necessary, the file of the desired piece should be
          indicated; e.g., Nce2, Raf1.</p></li>
<li><p>Captures are indicated with by putting an x between the
          piece type and the destination square; for pawns, the file
          of the capturing piece is used; e.g., fxg6, Qxa5.  When
          further disambiguation is necessary, full algebraic notation
          may be used; e.g., Qc3xa5.</p></li>
<li><p>Kingside castle is indicated with O-O, queenside with O-O-O.</p></li>
<li><p>A suffixed <em>+</em> indicates check, a suffixed <em>#</em> indicates
          checkmate.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>=</em> followed by a piece name indicates pawn promotion
          (pawn promotion indicator comes before check or checkmate
          indicator, if appropriate).</p></li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dt>    <strong>hybrids</strong></dt>
<dd>The disambiguator understands (obvious) hybrids as
    well; e.g., Pxg6.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Known problems</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Engine written entirely in Python and not designed for speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Game does not detect stalemate.</p></li>
<li><p>Castling and pawn promotion implementations are a little weird;
      they require stowing away data in attributes inside the pieces.</p></li>

</ul>
<h3>Wish list</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>A barely competent computer-controlled chess player would be
      nice.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be nice if the system truly understood complete PGN
      games, with all game notations.</p></li>
<li><p>A chess game browser would be nice, where a full game could be
      loaded and navigated.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be good if more game formats were understood, e.g.,
      Forsyth-Edwards notation, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Interaction with xboard would be swell.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for such notations as PxP (pawn takes pawn), as well 
      as other somewhat more traditional notations would be nice.</p></li>
<li><p>This was chiefly written before I had upgraded to 2.0, so some
      1.5-isms are around.</p></li>
